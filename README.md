# Objective of this notebook

The objective of this project is to try to show how do I think when I develop a ML model, this attempt will be done through a simple and complete approach to time-series problem with linear regression and Fourier series. For this, I will draw some dimensions this notebook will/won't cover:

- I will do an applied (and fictional) business case of this project. However, for this I will need to do some assumptions that are explained in the notebook.
- We will compare typical time-series base line models (last observation, historical mean, and historical median) vs multivariate linear regression (with deterministic processes)

This notebook won't cover tree-based models as the final increase in performance obtained are sufficient for a business case application. However, in a future I will do a purely-technical approach comparing the models in this projects with tree-based models + trend (as tree based models don't overpolate), and LSTM.

You are more than welcome to give me feedback about the approach of this problem.
